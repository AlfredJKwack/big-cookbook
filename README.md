Big Notes
=============

* Thou shalt : 
	* regenerate thumbnails on your blog upon activation.


To Do:
=============
* Styling of right hand menu
* Styling of left menu buttons for contrast and look
* Styling of the 'older posts' button on the left menu pane. Also look into default # loading loop and what the user settings could affect.
* Change mousepointer on right hand pane when left menu is open (and trap clicks to close menu. Hover over logo to see it now.
* Separate out the logo into its own CSS file
* Unify the color scheme with something like LESS 
* Check final location of stylesheet(s) will be in line with what users need to be able to override easily
* Prepare build scripts to uglify it all
* Create configuration screens for wordpress (check major templates for ideas)
	* Left hand menu width settings
	* Logo upload
	* Color scheme selector
	* Google font selector(s) and general font sizes
	* Space for google analytics scripts
* Test 
	* Find a Wordpress Testbed
	* Do cross-browser checks
* Make a nice search screen
* Avoid ever loading the boring UL with months archives. It currently occurs when individual articles are called directly from the URL.
* Add some eye candy to the 'article loading' message during ajax calls.

Nice to Haves:
=============
* Integrate a plugin that would allow to narrow a search based on selecting tags (ie what recipies have these ingredients)
* left menu button hover = peek
