Big Notes
=============

* Thou shalt : 
	* regenerate thumbnails on your blog upon activation.


To Do:
=============
* Check final location of stylesheet(s) will be in line with what users need to be able to override easily
* Prepare build scripts to uglify it all
* Create configuration screens for wordpress (check major templates for ideas)
	* Left hand menu width settings
	* Logo upload
	* Color scheme selector
		* Review the right mix of controls. Not sure it's balanced right now. Maybe 4 sections: article, hero image, right menu, article list.
			* Article 
				* background = article list tile text
				* Article text = right menu button
				* Article text accent
				* All links etc are a muted text accent?
			* Hero image 
				* backgound = article list tile image background
				* Text elements = article text elements
				* All links etc are a muted backgound?
			* Right hand menu independent background, text, headers controls
			* Article list
				* background = 

		* I
	* Google font selector(s) and general font sizes
	* Space for google analytics scripts
* Test 
	* Find a Wordpress Testbed
	* Do cross-browser checks
* Make a nice search screen
* Avoid ever loading the boring UL with months archives. It currently occurs when individual articles are called directly from the URL.
* Add some eye candy to the 'article loading' message during ajax calls.
* Responsiveness

Nice to Haves:
=============
* Integrate a plugin that would allow to narrow a search based on selecting tags (ie what recipies have these ingredients)
* left menu button hover = peek
